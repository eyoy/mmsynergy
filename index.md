# ABSTRACT

Although short-form dancing videos are rapidly emerging as a dominant format for both entertainment and marketing on social media platforms, there is a lack of systematic dance video quality measures that can guide influencers in crafting more impactful content and empower brands to predict multifaceted consumer engagement. In this study, we introduce a novel, deep learning-based measure called Music-Motion Synergy (MM Synergy) to assess the quality of dancing videos shared on social media. To develop this measure, we propose a new Context-Aware Multi-Task Multimodal Transformer (CA-MulT-MTL) model. Our model addresses four key challenges, including: (1) capturing core dancing content with sequential unstructured data on audio and body movement, (2) understanding the interactions between multimodal elements, (3) simultaneously predict diverse engagement metrics that reflect management-relevant objectives, and (4) incorporating contextual video information. We instantiate our CA-MulT-MTL model based on a sample of 79, 588 short-form dancing videos on TikTok and find it outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning benchmark models. Through a validation test, we find that our model-predicted MM Synergy with human ratings on MM Synergy. Our model-predicted MM Synergy also can predict consumer affective attitudes towards videos. Furthermore, we establish the causal impact of MM Synergy levels on consumersâ€™ video watch intention, purchase intention, and the probability of liking through an online controlled experiment.
